                I started programming with <em>Kotlin.</em> I found the whole 
                programming world quite fun and the tutorial was super easy to follow
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <em>until it was time to code...</em>

                Nothing worked! Android Studio was throwing strings of errors. I spent days 
                making sure I have entered the same same set of characters as
                the tutor. I googled and googled &mdash; nothing worked
                <br/>

                    I was broken, my code was broken. Until one morning
                    I just woke up feeling confident I have the fix. I don't 
                    even know how but it just worked! I was so happy and I loved the feeling

                I started learning Javascript later on and got an internship at KodeCamp as a nodeJS 
                developer where I built the api to serve an ecommerce website with <em>nodeJS(express) </em> 
                and mongodb. <br /><br /> After kodecamp I worked at HNG, Onicon, SkyStudio, InstaOps where I developed appications with reactJS, and then
                started using python(django) for fullstack development.

                I love being indoors, I love jazz music and play the piano.

                I also take time to <a style={{textDecoration:'underline'}} href={navLinks.blog}>write</a> on programming concepts and tools.

                I love jazz music, I love watching dark clouds, I love the sound of french words.
